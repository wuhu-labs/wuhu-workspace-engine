# SQLite index on properties table

The `properties` table is queried frequently by `key`. We should add an index
on `(key, value)` to speed up lookups.

## Reproduction

Run a workspace with 500+ documents and measure query time for:

```sql
SELECT d.path FROM docs d
JOIN properties p ON d.path = p.path
WHERE p.key = 'status' AND p.value = 'open'
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add index on `properties(key, value)`
- [ ] Benchmark before/after with 1000-document workspace

# Built-in kinds (document, issue) are always available.
# Define custom kinds here with their known properties.
# Each kind gets an extension table: kind + "s" (e.g., projects).
# Properties listed here become columns in the extension table.
# Any frontmatter property NOT listed here still goes to the
# universal `properties` table for ad-hoc queries.

kinds:
  - kind: project
    properties:
      - status
      - priority
      - owner
